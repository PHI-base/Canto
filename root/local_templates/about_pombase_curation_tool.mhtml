<!-- PAGE_TITLE: About Canto: the PomBase community curation tool -->

Canto is an online annotation tool which has been developed to allow
researchers to curate the genetic and molecular data from their publications
for inclusion in public biological databases. Fission yeast data curated in
Canto will have priority for inclusion in the PomBase model organism database,
and will therefore also be rapidly disseminated to other databases
(e.g. GenBank/ENA/DDBJ, UniProt, BioGRID and GO).
