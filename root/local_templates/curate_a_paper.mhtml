<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Curating a paper with Canto -->
<p>
For newly published papers, PomBase curators will email authors inviting them
to participate, with specific instructions and links. Lab members are also
welcome to evaluate existing annotations and create new annotations from past
publications.
</p>
<p>
  <& /tools/pubmed_id_start.mhtml, title => 'If you wish to curate a paper from your laboratory, please enter the PubMed ID and proceed as directed.' &>
</p>
<p>
You will be asked to supply the genes from you publication. You can then
annotate your genes with:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Phenotypes (including details of alleles and conditions)</li>
  <li>GO terms (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions)</li>
  <li>Genetic and physical interactions (BioGRID format)</li>
  <li>Protein modifications</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once you have begun curating the information will be preserved at this URL, so
you do not need to complete the curation in one session. You can use the
'Contact curators' link at any point if you get stuck, or have any questions.
</p>
<p>
Please note that you should only curate information supported by experiments
supported in the paper you are curating. If you want to capture other
information not directly shown in a particular paper, please contact us
directly.  [<& /contact.mhtml, link_text => 'contact curators ...' &>].
</p>
<p>
If you have a large gene list with only one of two types of data (e.g. a
phenotype screen), you may want to supply the data as spreadsheet rather than
via Canto. Please contact us directly for format details.
