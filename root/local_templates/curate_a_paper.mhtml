<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Curating a paper with Canto -->
<p>
PomBase curators will email authors inviting them to curate newly published
papers.  Lab members are also welcome to evaluate existing annotations and
create new annotations from past publications.
</p>
<p>
  <& /tools/pubmed_id_start.mhtml, title => 'If you wish to curate a paper from your laboratory, please enter the PubMed ID and proceed as directed.' &>
</p>
<p>
You will be asked to supply the genes from your publication. You can then
annotate your genes with:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Phenotypes (including details of alleles and conditions)</li>
  <li>GO terms (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions)</li>
  <li>Genetic and physical interactions (BioGRID format)</li>
  <li>Protein modifications</li>
</ol>
<p>
At present, gene names and product descriptions cannot be changed using Canto. 
Existing annotations also cannot be altered or deleted.
If you have new gene names or updated product descriptions, or if you notice 
any errors in existing annotations, please put them in the comment box that 
you will see when you submit your annotations.
</p>
<p>
Once you have begun curating the information will be preserved at a stable URL, so
you do not need to complete the curation in one session. You can use the
'Contact curators' link at any point if you get stuck, or have any questions.
</p>
<p>
Please note that you should only curate information supported by experiments
supported in the paper you are curating. If you want to capture other
information not directly shown in a particular paper, please <& /contact.mhtml, link_text => 'contact us directly' &>.
</p>
<p>
If you have a large gene list with only one of two types of data (e.g. a
phenotype screen), you may want to supply the data as spreadsheet rather than
via Canto. Please <& /contact.mhtml, link_text => 'contact us directly' &> for format details.
