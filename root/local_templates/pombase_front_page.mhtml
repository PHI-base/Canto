<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Welcome to Canto -->
<p>
  This site hosts the <a href="http://www.pombase.org">PomBase</a> community
  curation tool: Canto.
</p>
<p>
  Canto is an online annotation tool which has been developed to allow
  researchers to curate the genetic and molecular data from their publications
  for inclusion in public biological databases. Fission yeast data curated in
  Canto will have priority for inclusion in the PomBase model organism database,
  and will therefore also be rapidly disseminated to other databases
  (e.g. GenBank/ENA/DDBJ, UniProt, BioGRID and GO).
</p>
<p>
  Originally created for members of the fission yeast community, Canto is a
  generic tool which can be readily configured for use with other organisms and
  other databases.
