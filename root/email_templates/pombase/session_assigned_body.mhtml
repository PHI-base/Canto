Dear <% $curator_name %>,

Congratulations on the recent publication of your paper:
  <% $publication_uniquename %> - "<% $publication_title %>".

We invite you to contribute annotations based on this paper to PomBase.  Any
annotations you make will be prioritised for inclusion in PomBase, and will
therefore also be readily visible in other databases such as GO, UniProtKB,
BioGRID, etc.

Your curation link is:
  <% $session_link %>

When you follow the above link and sign in, you will be guided step-by-step
though the annotation process. You can annotate these data types in the tool:

  Gene Ontology (molecular function, biological process, cellular component)
  Phenotypes 
  Genetic Interactions
  Physical Interactions
  Protein Modifications
% if ($existing_annotation_count > 0) {

For this paper, there are several previously curated annotations in the
database. These existing annotations will be shown in the curation tool, but
cannot be altered. If you notice any problems with existing annotations,
please let the curators know.
% }

Help is available on each page, and you can also read
the Canto manual (<% $help_index %>) or contact
the PomBase staff (mailto:<% $config->{contact_email}->{address} %>)
for assistance at any time. You will also have an opportunity to provide any
data that the tool does not capture so that curators can include it with your
curation.

The curation link will work indefinitely, so you can leave and return to the
same URL as often as you want. You can also invite a co-author to help curate
the paper by changing the "session assignment" before submitting your
annotations.

We greatly appreciate your contribution -- all community annotations help keep
PomBase literature curation comprehensive, accurate, and up to date.

Sincerely yours,

The PomBase Team
