Dear <% $curator_known_as // $curator_name %>,

We invite you to contribute annotations based on your recently
published paper, <% $publication_uniquename %> -
<% wrap('  ', '  ', '"' . $publication_title . '"') %>,
to <% $config->{database_name} %>.  We have
identified the paper as suitable for curation in <% $config->{name} %>, but if
it reports data for a large number of genes, please let us know so we can
collect the data by a different route.

Your curation link is:
  <% $session_link %>

When you follow the above link, you can start curating, or assign the session
to a colleague (e.g. a member of your lab). You can annotate these data types
in the tool:

<& ../annotation_type_list.mhtml, config => $config &>\
% if ($existing_annotation_count > 0) {

For this paper, there are several previously curated annotations in the
database. These existing annotations will be shown in the curation tool, but
cannot be altered. If you notice any problems with existing annotations,
please let the curators know.
% }

Help is available on each page, and you can also read
the <% $config->{name} %> manual (<% $help_index %>) or contact
the help desk (<% $config->{contact_email}->{address} %>)
for assistance at any time. You will also have an opportunity to provide any
data that the tool does not capture so that curators can include it with your
curation.

The curation link will work indefinitely, so you can leave and return to the
same URL as often as you want.

We greatly appreciate your contribution: all community annotations help keep
<% $config->{database_name} %> literature curation comprehensive, accurate, and
up to date.

<% $session_link %>

Sincerely yours,

% if ($config->{email_signature}) {
<% $config->{email_signature} %>
% } else {
The <% $config->{database_name} %> team
% }
