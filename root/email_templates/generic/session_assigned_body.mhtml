Dear <% $curator_name %>,

The curation link is:

Congratulations on the recent publication of your paper,
<% $publication_uniquename %> - "<% $publication_title %>".
We invite you to contribute annotations based on this paper.

Your curation link is:

<% $session_link %>

When you follow the above link and sign in, you will be guided step-by-step
though the annotation process. You can annotate these data types in the tool:

<& ../annotation_type_list.mhtml, config => $config &>

Help is available on each page, and you can also read
the Canto manual (<% $help_index %>) or contact
the help desk (<% $config->{contact_email}->{address} %>)
for assistance at any time. You will also have an opportunity to provide any
data that the tool does not capture so that curators can include it with your
curation.

The curation link will work indefinitely, so you can leave and return to the
same URL as often as you want. You can also invite a co-author to help curate
the paper by changing the "session assignment" before submitting your
annotations.

We greatly appreciate your contribution.
