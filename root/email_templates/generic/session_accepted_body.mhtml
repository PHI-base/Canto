Thank you for agreeing to curate:
  <% $publication_uniquename %> - "<% $publication_title %>"

Your curation link is:
  <% $session_link %>

You can annotate these data types in the tool:
<& ../annotation_type_list.mhtml, config => $config &>

If a colleague has asked you to annotate this paper, you will also be
able to modify any annotations your colleague made.

% if ($existing_annotation_count > 0) {
For this paper, there are also several previously curated annotations in the
database.  These existing annotations will be shown in the curation tool, but
cannot be altered. If you notice any problems with existing annotations,
please let the curators know.

% }
Help is available on each page, and you can also read the Canto manual
(<% $help_index %>) or contact the help desk
(<% $config->{contact_email}->{address} %>) for assistance at any time. You
will also have an opportunity to provide any data that the tool does not
capture so that curators can include it with your curation.

The curation link will work indefinitely, so you can leave and return to the
same URL as often as you want. When you have added all the annotations you
can, you may either submit the annotations to the curators, or send
the paper to another co-author for further curation.

We greatly appreciate your contribution.
