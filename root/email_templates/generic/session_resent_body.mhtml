Dear <% $curator_name %>,

We recently invited you to contribute annotations based on your paper,
<% $publication_uniquename %> -
<% wrap('  ', '  ', '"' . $publication_title . '"') %>,
to <% $config->{database_name} %>.

We have noticed, however, that no action has been taken on the curation
session. Please visit the page linked below, where you can either start
curating the paper, or reassign it to another author (e.g. the first author).

Your curation link is:
  <% $session_link %>

To reassign this session, use the "reassign" button, and enter the author's
name and email address. To curate the publication yourself, click "start
curating" and then follow the simple step-by-step instructions to capture the
experimental data reported in your paper.

If you begin curation, and are then unsure what to do next, or if you believe
that this paper is not suitable for curation in <% $config->{name} %>, please
send a message to <% $config->{contact_email}->{address} %> for assistance or
advice.

We greatly appreciate your contribution: all community annotations help keep
<% $config->{database_name} %> literature curation comprehensive, accurate, and
up to date.

<% $session_link %>

Sincerely yours,

<% $logged_in_user->name() %>
