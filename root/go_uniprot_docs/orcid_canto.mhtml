<h3>What is ORCID?</h3>

<p>
ORCID provides every researcher with a stable, unique identifier that
can be connected with publications and other outputs.
</p>

<p>
Learn more, and register for an identifier, on the <a
href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID site</a>.
</p>

<h3>How does Canto use ORCID?</h3>
<p>
When you provide your ORCID identifier, the Canto database can
associate every annotation you curate with your ID as well as with the
paper it comes from. At present these connections are stored for
future use; we plan to update Canto to provide a view of what any
individual curator has annotated for a given publication.
</p>

<p>
PomBase curators are also exploring options for propagating links
between ORCID-identified individuals and their annotations beyond
Canto, so that researchers can reliably cite their contributions to
PomBase, e.g. to meet data dissemination requirements for grants.
