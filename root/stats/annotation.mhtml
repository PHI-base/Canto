Number of papers annotated by curator (professional vs. community), by year,
and number of annotations. An annotation is either i) and assignment of a gene
product to a term in and ontology, or a genetic or physical interaction
between two gene products. Annotations to the same ontology term with
different annotation extensions are classed as independent annotations.
Any paper which is fully or partially curated by a community curator is
classed as a 'community curated' publication. Prior to 2013, any annotation in
a community curated session were assigned to the community curator. However,
since the end of 2012 subsequent annotation made by professional curators are
attributed to the curator who made the annotation.
Annotations are date stamped with the 'annotation creation date'. Publications
are date stamped with the date that the curation session for the publication
was approved. This accounts for apparent discrepancy between annotations made
and publications curated.
