<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Introduction to Canto -->

<p>
When you start curating a paper, you will first be asked to supply the
genes from your publication.  You can then annotate your genes with any of
these data types:
</p>
<dl>
% for my $an_type (@annotation_type_list) {
  <li>
    <h3><% $an_type->{display_name} %></h3>
    <div><% $an_type->{help_text} // '' %></div>
  </li>
% }
</dl>
<p>
At present, gene names and product descriptions cannot be changed using Canto. 
Existing annotations also cannot be altered or deleted.
If you have new gene names or updated product descriptions, or if you notice 
any errors in existing annotations, please put them in the comment box that 
you will see when you submit your annotations.
</p>
<p>
Once you have begun curating, the information will be preserved at a stable URL, so
you do not need to complete the curation in one session. You can use the
'Contact curators' link at any point if you get stuck, or have any questions.
</p>
<p>
Please note that you should only curate information supported by
experiments supported in the paper you are curating. If you want to
capture other information not directly shown in a particular paper,
please <& /contact.mhtml, link_text => 'contact us directly' &>.
</p>
<p>
If you have a large gene list with only one or two types of data (e.g. a
phenotype screen), you may want to supply the data as spreadsheet rather than
via Canto. Please <& /contact.mhtml, link_text => 'contact us directly' &> for format details.
</p>
