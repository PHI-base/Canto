<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Curating Physical Interactions -->
<!-- FLAGS: use_bootstrap -->

<p>
If you have physical interactions to curate, please read the
Directionality section carefully.
</p>
<p>
When you choose 'Physical interaction', you go to a page that lists
all of the genes you have entered for the paper. Select one or more
genes, then click 'Proceed' to go to the evidence selection page.
</p>
<p>
Note that only pairwise physical interactions can be annotated in
Canto. Thus, if you choose more than one interacting gene, you will
create two or more separate interaction annotations, with the same
evidence.
</p>
<p>
On the evidence selection page, choose from the pulldown menu. Some
evidence types have a brief description that indicates the
directionality. Further information on evidence supporting physical
interactions is available an the <a
href="http://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/experimental_systems#physical_interactions">BioGRID
help wiki</a> and in the Directionality section below. Click 'Proceed'
to finish the annotation and return to the paper summary page.
</p>

<h2>Directionality</h2>
<p>
Some experiments that detect physical interactions
have an inherent directionality. For example, in a typical two-hybrid
experiment one protein (A) is fused to a DNA binding domain and a
second (B) is fused to a transcription activation domain. The
reciprocal experiment, with A fused to the activation domain and B
fused to the DNA binding domain, may or may not have been done.
</p>
<p>
For such "asymmetric" interactions, Canto allows you to curate in only
one direction starting from the gene you have selected, as indicated
in the evidence selector.
</p>
<p>
If the evidence description looks the wrong way around, you will have
to change genes and start again. (You can finish and then delete an
interaction annotation if you find that you have started with the
wrong gene.)

Use one of the Affinity Capture evidence types for
co-immunoprecipitation.

If you have done the experiment in both directions, you should curate
two annotations to describe the interaction completely. Curate
starting from one gene, then switch genes to annotate the reciprocal
experiment.

Other experiment types are "symmetric" and therefore only need to be
entered once, and you can start from either of the interacting genes.

*Note that PCA is not exactly symmetric, since there will be one
 N-terminal and one C-terminal reporter fusion construct, but it is
 treated as symmetric in Canto.
