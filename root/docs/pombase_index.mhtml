Notes
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>At present, gene names and product descriptions cannot be changed using
   Canto.  Existing annotations also cannot be altered or deleted. If you have
   new gene names or updated product descriptions, or if you notice any errors
   in existing annotations, please put them in a comment when you submit your
   annotations.
  </li>
  <li>
   If you have a large gene list with only one or two types of data (e.g. a
   phenotype screen), you may want to supply the data as spreadsheet rather
   than via Canto. Please <& /contact.mhtml, link_text => 'contact us
   directly' &> for format details.
