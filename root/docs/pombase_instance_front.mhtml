Once you have found your paper, you can curate GO, phenotypes, interactions
and protein modifications. See the help pages for more information.
By curating your papers here, you will make your work more visible to the
community. Your data will be available in PomBase and shared with
other public databases. Read more about the motivation, background, and
progress of the Fission Yeast Community Curation project at the
