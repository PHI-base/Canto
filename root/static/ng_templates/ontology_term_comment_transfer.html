If you have any additional information that you 
haven't been able to represent using the ontology term and evidence please add
a comment. For 
example, you may provide the target of a protein kinase or transcription 
factor (use the gene name or systematic ID), the cell cycle phase when a 
specific process occurs or a localization is observed, the amino acid 
residues for a modification, etc. The curators may be able to capture this 
additional information in an "annotation extension". You can also include 
the figure or table number that shows the results on which this annotation 
is based.
