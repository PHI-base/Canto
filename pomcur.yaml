    help_text: >
      A molecular function is an activity, such as a catalytic or binding
      activitiy, that occurs at the molecular level. GO molecular function
      terms represent activities that perform the actions (protein
      serine/threonine kinase activity, pyruvate carboxylase activity),
      rather than the entities (gene products or complexes).
    more_help_text: >
      As a general rule, molecular functions  correspond to single step
      activities performed by individual gene products.

    help_text: >
      A biological process is series of events accomplished by one or more
      ordered assemblies of molecular functions.
    more_help_text: >
      It can be difficult to distinguish between a biological process
      and a molecular function, but the general rule is that a process must
      have more than one distinct steps (eg. cell cycle, transport, signal
      transduction).
    suggest_term_help_text: >
      A new term should be differentiated from the parent as a "sub term"  by
      the mechanism of action, or the genes which are required to perform the
      action. It should not be differentiated only by its target gene
      products. For example, histone H2A-S121 phosphorylation
      is a valid term request because it is performed by a set of genes
      specific for this process, translation of histone H2a is not a valid
      term request because there is no translation machinery specifically for
      histone H2a.

      Cellular component describes locations, at the levels of

      cellular components include nucleus, nuclear inner membrane, nuclear
      pore, and proteasome complex.

      Generally, a gene product is located in or is a subcomponent of a
      particular cellular component. The cellular component ontology includes
      multi-subunit enzymes and other protein complexes, but not individual
      proteins or nucleic acids. Cellular component also does not include
      multicellular anatomical terms.

      A phenotype is any observable characteristic or trait of an organism;
      such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological
      properties, behavior, and products of behaviour.
    more_help_text: >
      Phenotypes result from the expression of the genes of an organism as well
      as the influence of environmental factors and the interactions between
      the two.
